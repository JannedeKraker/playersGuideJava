## Day 41 Challenge: Maelstroms
The Uncoded One knows the significance of the Fountain of Objects and has placed minions in the
caverns to defend it. One of these is the maelstrom—a sentient, malevolent wind. Encountering a
maelstrom does not result in instant death, but entering a room containing a maelstrom causes the
player to be swept away to another room. The maelstrom also moves to a new location. If the player is
moved to another dangerous location, such as a pit, that room’s effects will happen upon landing in that
room.
A player can hear the growling and groaning of a maelstrom from a neighboring room (including
diagonals), which gives them a clue to be careful.
Modify the basic Fountain of Objects game in the ways below to add maelstroms to the game.

**Objectives**:

- Add a maelstrom to the small 4×4 game in a location of your choice.
- The player can sense maelstroms by hearing them in adjacent rooms. (“You hear the growling and
groaning of a maelstrom nearby.”)
- If a player enters a room with a maelstrom, the player moves one space north and two spaces east,
while the maelstrom moves one space south and two spaces west. When the player is moved like
this, tell them so. If this would move the player or maelstrom beyond the map’s edge, ensure they
stay on the map. (Clamp them to the map, wrap around to the other side, or any other strategy. ) --> ik denk dat ik hem dan ergens random laat neer komen in de grid, de player en de maelstrom.
- Note: When combined with the Small, Medium, or Large challenge, place one maelstrom into the
medium-sized game and two into the large-sized game.
