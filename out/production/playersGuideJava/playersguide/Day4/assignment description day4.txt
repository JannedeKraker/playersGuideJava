## Day 4- Challenge: The Variable Shop
You see an old shopkeeper struggling to stack up variables in a window display. “Hoo-wee! All these
variable types sure are exciting but setting them all up to show them off to excited new programmers
like yourself is a lot of work for these aching bones,” she says. “You wouldn’t mind helping me set up this
program with one variable of every type, would you?”

**Objectives:**

- Build a program with a variable of all eight primitive Java types (as well as the 'text' type).
- Assign each of them a value using a literal of the correct type.
- Use System.out.println to display the contents of each variable.
