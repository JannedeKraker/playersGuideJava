## Narrative 6: The Fountain Remade
You scramble through the dark Cavern of Objects, crawling and feeling your way to the Fountain of
Objects. The dripping sound that you hear is a giveaway that you have found it. You pull Simula’s green
gem—the Heart of Object-Oriented Programming—out of your pack and hold it in the palm of your
hand, contemplating the journey you have taken to get here.You slide your hand along the Fountain until
you find a small recess, just big enough for the Heart to be placed. You slide the green gem in, and the
fountain immediately comes to life. The water in the fountain, previously still, suddenly begins churning
and overflowing onto the ground around you. You make a hasty escape to the cavern entrance.
Within minutes, water rushes out the entrance and through a thousand other holes in the mountainside,
collecting into a raging waterfall down into the valley below. Within days, the newly restored River of
Objects will flow to the sea, restoring its life-giving power to the entire island.
With the River of Objects flowing again, the land will become bountiful with objects of every class,
interface, and struct imaginable. The island has been saved. You turn your attention towards the
scattered islands on the horizon and your final destination beyond: a confrontation with The Uncoded
One.

## Narrative 7: The Harvest of Objects
A few days have passed since the Fountain of Objects was restored, but the land has already become
more vibrant and lush. New objects and classes, unseen for thousands of clock cycles, have been found
again. The classes described in this level represent a collection of some of the most versatile and
interesting ones you have seen, and you gather some up for the rest of your journey.

## Day 44 Challenge 1/2: The Robot Pilot
When we first made the Hunting the Manticore game in day 18, we required two human players: one to
set up the Manticore’s range from the city and the other to destroy it. With Random, we can turn this
into a single-player game by randomly picking the range for the Manticore.

**Objectives**:

- Modify your Hunting the Manticore game to be a single-player game by having the computer pick a
random range between 0 and 100 (you can use the `Random` class for that).
- Answer this question: How might you use inheritance, polymorphism, or interfaces to allow the
game to be either a single player (the computer randomly chooses the starting location and
direction) or two players (the second human determines the starting location and direction)?

## Day 44 Challenge 2/2: Time in the Cavern
With LocalDateTime and Duration, you can track how much time a player spends in the Cavern of Objects
to beat the game. With these tools, modify your Fountain of Objects game to display how much time a
player spent exploring the caverns.

**Objectives**:

- When a new game begins, capture the current time using LocalDateTime.
- When a game finishes (win or loss), capture the current time.
- Use Duration to compute how much time elapsed and display that to the player.
