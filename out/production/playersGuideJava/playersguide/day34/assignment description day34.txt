## Day 34 Challenge: The Old Robot
You spot something shiny, half-buried in the mud. You pull it out and realize that it seems to be some
mechanical automaton with the words “Property of Dynamak” etched into it. As you knock off the caked-on mud, you realize that it seems like this old automaton
might even be programmable if you can give it the proper commands. The automaton seems to be structured like this:
```
class Robot {
    private int x;

    private int y;

    private boolean isPowered;

    private RobotCommand[] commands = new RobotCommand[3];

    public void run() {
        for (RobotCommand command : commands) {
            command.run(this);
            System.out.printf("[%d %d %b]\n", x, y, isPowered);
        }
    }
}
```
You don’t see a definition of that RobotCommand class. Still, you think you might be able to recreate it
(a class with only an abstract `run` command) and then make derived classes that extend RobotCommand
that move it in each of the four directions and power it on and off. (You wish you could manufacture a
whole army of these!)

**Objectives**:

- Copy the code above into a new project.
- Create a RobotCommand class with a public and abstract void run(Robot robot) method. (The
code above should compile after this step.)
- Make OnCommand and OffCommand classes that inherit from RobotCommand and turn the robot
on or off by overriding the `run` method.
- Make a NorthCommand, SouthCommand, WestCommand, and EastCommand that move the robot 1
unit in the +y direction, 1 unit in the -y direction, 1 unit in the -x direction, and 1 unit in the +x
direction, respectively. Also, ensure that these commands only work if the robot’s isPowered is true.
- Make your main method able to collect three commands from the console window. Generate new
RobotCommand objects based on the text entered. After filling the robot’s command set with these
new RobotCommand objects, use the robot’s `run` method to execute them. For example:
```
on
north
west

[0 0 True]
[0 1 True]
[-1 1 True]
```
- Note: You might find this strategy for making commands that update other objects useful in some
of the larger challenges in the coming levels.
