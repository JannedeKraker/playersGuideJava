- Add a maelstrom to the small 4×4 game in a location of your choice.

- The player can sense maelstroms by hearing them in adjacent rooms. (“You hear the growling and
groaning of a maelstrom nearby.”)

- If a player enters a room with a maelstrom, the player moves one space north and two spaces east,
while the maelstrom moves one space south and two spaces west. When the player is moved like
this, tell them so. If this would move the player or maelstrom beyond the map’s edge, ensure they
stay on the map. (Clamp them to the map, wrap around to the other side, or any other strategy. ) --> ik denk dat ik hem dan ergens random laat neer komen in de grid, de player en de maelstrom.

- Note: When combined with the Small, Medium, or Large challenge, place one maelstrom into the
medium-sized game and two into the large-sized game.
