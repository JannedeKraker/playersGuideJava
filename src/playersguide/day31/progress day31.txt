I started, I created a player.
and a game board.
Now I have to work on making the methods in GameboardTicTacToo
such that the players can fill in x and o's in the right place.
I am at the setXAtGameBoard method.

I managed to get the board filled out.
But he does not yet check whether there is a winner or not.
So I have to continue with that.

she checks if there is a winner.
Now i have to work on if there is a winner, the player counts how much times he has won.
