- The world consists of a grid of rooms, where each room can be referenced by its row and column. Initially, the grid consists of 4 x 4 is 16 rooms.
North is up, east is right, south is down, and west is left:

- The game’s flow works like this: The player is told what they can sense in the dark (see, hear, smell).
Then the player gets a chance to perform some action by typing it in. Their chosen action is resolved
(the player moves, state of things in the game changes, checking for a win or a loss, etc.). Then the
loop repeats.
- Most rooms are empty rooms, and there is nothing to sense.
- The player is in one of the rooms and can move between them by typing commands like the
following: “move north”, “move south”, “move east”, and “move west”. The player should not be able
to move past the end of the map.
- The room at (Row=0, Column=0) is the cavern entrance (and exit). The player should start here.The
player can sense light coming from outside the cavern when in this room. (“You see light in this room
coming from outside the cavern. This is the entrance.”)
- The room at (Row=0, Column=2) is the fountain room, containing the Fountain of Objects itself. The
Fountain can be either enabled or disabled. The player can hear the fountain but hears different
things depending on if it is on or not. (“You hear water dripping in this room. The Fountain of Objects
is here!” or “You hear the rushing waters from the Fountain of Objects. It has been reactivated!”) The
fountain is off initially. In the fountain room, the player can type “enable fountain” to enable it. If the
player is not in the fountain room and runs this, there should be no effect, and the player should be
told so.
- The player wins by moving to the fountain room, enabling the Fountain of Objects, and moving back
to the cavern entrance. If the player is in the entrance and the fountain is on, the player wins.
- Use different colors to display the different types of text in the console window. For example,
narrative items (intro, ending, etc.) may be magenta, descriptive text in white, input from the user
in cyan, text describing entrance light in yellow, messages about the fountain in blue.
- An example of what the program might look like is shown below:
```----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are in the room at (Row=0, Column=0).
You see light coming from the cavern entrance.
What do you want to do? move east
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are in the room at (Row=0, Column=1).
What do you want to do? move east
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are in the room at (Row=0, Column=2).
You hear water dripping in this room. The Fountain of Objects is here!
What do you want to do? enable fountain
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are in the room at (Row=0, Column=2).
You hear the rushing waters from the Fountain of Objects. It has been reactivated!
What do you want to do? move west
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are in the room at (Row=0, Column=1).
What do you want to do? move west
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are in the room at (Row=0, Column=0).
The Fountain of Objects has been reactivated, and you have escaped with your life!
