## Day 42 Challenge 1/2: Amaroks
The Uncoded One has also placed amaroks in the caverns to protect the fountain from people like you.
Amaroks are giant, rotting, wolf-like creatures that stalk the caverns.When players enter a room with an
amarok, they are instantly killed, and the game is over. Players can smell an amarok in any adjacent room
(all eight directions), which tells them that an amarok is nearby.
Modify the basic Fountain of Objects game as described below.

**Objectives**:

- Amarok locations are up to you. Pick a room to place an amarok aside from the entrance or fountain
room in the small 4×4 world.
- When a player is in one of the eight spaces adjacent to an amarok, a message should be displayed
when sensing surroundings that indicate that the player can smell the amarok nearby. For example,
“You can smell the rotten stench of an amarok in a nearby room.”
- When a player enters a room with an amarok, the player dies and loses the game.
- Note: When combined with the Small, Medium, or Large challenge, place two amaroks in the medium
level and three in the large level in locations of your choosing.
