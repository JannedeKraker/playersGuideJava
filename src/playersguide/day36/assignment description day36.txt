## Day 36 Challenge: Room Coordinates
The time to enter the Fountain of Objects draws closer. While you don’t know what to expect, you have
found some scrolls that describe the area in ancient times. It seems to be structured as a set of rooms
in a grid-like arrangement.
Locations of the room may be represented as a row and column, and you take it upon yourself to try to
capture this concept with a new record definition.

**Objectives**:

- Create a Coordinate record that can represent a room coordinate with a row and column.
- Ensure Coordinate is immutable.
- Make a method to determine if one coordinate is adjacent to another (differing only by a single row
or column).
- Write a main method that creates a few coordinates and determines if they are adjacent to each
other to prove that it is working correctly.
