## Day 11 Challenge 1 of 2: Buying Inventory
It is time to resupply. A nearby outfitter shop has the supplies you need but is so disorganized that they
cannot sell things to you. “Can’t sell if I can’t find the price list,” Tortuga, the owner, tells you as he turns
over and attempts to go back to sleep in his reclining chair in the corner.
There’s a simple solution: use your programming powers to build something to report the prices of
various pieces of equipment, based on the user’s selection:
The following items are available:

1. Rope
2. Torches
3. Climbing Equipment
4. Clean Water
5. Machete
6. Canoe
7. Food Supplies

What number do you want to see the price of? 2
Torches cost 15 gold.
You search around the shop and find ledgers that show the following prices for these items: Rope: 10
gold, Torches: 15 gold, Climbing Equipment: 25 gold, Clean Water: 1 gold, Machete: 20 gold, Canoe: 200
gold, Food Supplies: 1 gold.

**Objectives:**

- Build a program that will show the menu illustrated above.
- Ask the user to enter a number from the menu.
- Using the information above, use a switch (either type) to show the item’s cost.

## Day 11 Challenge 2 of 2: Discounted Inventory
After sorting through Tortuga’s outfitter shop and making it viable again, Tortuga realizes you’ve put him
back in business. He wants to repay the favor by giving you a 50% discount on anything you buy from
him, and he wants you to modify your program to reflect that.
After asking the user for a number, the program should also ask for their name. If the name supplied is
your name, cut the price in half before reporting it to the user.

**Objectives:**

- Modify your program from before to also ask the user for their name.
- If their name equals your name, divide the cost in half.
