## Narrative 2: Entering the Catacombs
You arrive at the Catacombs of the Class, the place that will reveal the path to the Fountain of Objects.
The Catacombs lie inside a mountain, with a wide stone entrance leading you into a series of three
chambers. In the first chamber, you find five pedestals with the remnants of a class definition and specific
instructions by each. Etched above a sealed doorway at the back of the room is the text, “Only the True
Programmer who can remake the Five Prototypes can proceed.” Each pedestal appears to have
instructions for crafting a class. These are the Five Prototypes that you must reassemble.

## Day 23 Challenge: The Point
The first pedestal asks you to create a Point class to store a point in two dimensions. Each point is
represented by an x-coordinate (x), a side-to-side distance from a special central point called the origin,
and a y-coordinate (y), an up-and-down distance away from the origin.

**Objectives**:

- Define a new Point class with fields and getter methods for x and y.
- Add a constructor to create a point from a specific x- and y-coordinate.
- Add a parameterless constructor to create a point at the origin (0, 0).
- In your main method, create a point at (2, 3) and another at (-4, 0). Display these points on the
console window in the format (x, y) to illustrate that the class works.
- Answer this question: Are your x and y immutable? Why did you choose what you did?
