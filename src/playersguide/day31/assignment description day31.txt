## Day 31 Design Challenge: Tic-Tac-Toe
Completing designs for the three games in the Chamber of Design causes the pedestals to light up red
again, and another door opens, letting you into the final chamber. This chamber has only a single large,
broad pedestal. Inscribed on the stone floor in a circle around the pedestal are the engraved words,“Only
a True Programmer can build object-oriented programs.”
More text engraved on the pedestal describes what you recognize as the game of Tic-Tac-Toe, stating
that in ancient times, inhabitants of the land would use this as a Battle of Wits to determine the outcome
of political strife. Instead of fighting wars, they would battle it out in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
Your job is to recreate the game of Tic-Tac-Toe, allowing two players to compete against each other. The
following features are required:
- Two human players first enter their names. Then they take turns entering their choice using the same keyboard.
- The players designate which square they want to play in. Hint: You might consider using the number
pad as a guide. For example, if they enter 7, they have chosen the top left corner of the board.
- The game should prevent players from choosing squares that are already occupied. If such a move
is attempted, the player should be told of the problem and given another chance.
- The game must detect when a player wins or when the board is full with no winner (draw/”cat”).
- When the game is over, the outcome is displayed to the players.
- The state of the board must be displayed to the player after each play. Hint: One possible way to
show the board could be like this:
```
It is X's turn.
   | X |
---+---+---
   | O | X
---+---+---
 O |   |
What square do you want to play in?
```

**Objectives**:

- Build the game of Tic-Tac-Toe as described in the requirements above. Starting with CRC cards is
recommended, but the goal is to make working software, not CRC cards.
- Answer this question: How might you modify your completed program if running multiple rounds
was a requirement (for example, a best-out-of-five series)?

**To study if you find this difficult yet:**
- Consider 2-dimensional arrays, or a [Map](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_hashmap.asp) to represent the board
