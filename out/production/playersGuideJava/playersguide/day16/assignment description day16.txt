## Day 16 Challenge: Taking a Number
Many previous tasks have required getting a number from a user. To save time writing this code
repeatedly, you have decided to make a method to do this common task.

**Objectives:**

- Make a method with the signature int askForNumber(String text). Display the text parameter in the console window, get a response from the user, convert it to an int, and return it.
This might look like this: int result = askForNumber("What is the airspeed velocity
of an unladen swallow?");.
- Make a method with the signature `int askForNumberInRange(String text, int min, int
max)`. Only return if the entered number is between the min and max values. Otherwise, ask again.
- Place these methods in at least one of your previous programs to improve it.
