## Day 3 Challenge: The Thing Namer 3000
As you walk through the city of Commenton, admiring its forward-slash-based architectural buildings, a
young man approaches you in a panic. “I dropped my Thing Namer 3000 and broke it. I think it’s mostly
working, but all my variable names got reset! I don’t understand what they do!” He shows you the
following program:
```
System.out.println("What kind of thing are we talking about?");
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
String a = input.next();
System.out.println("How would you describe it? Big? Azure? Tattered?");
String b = input.next();
String c = "of Doom";
String d = "3000";
System.out.println("The " + b + " " + a + " of " + c + " " + d + "!");
```
“You gotta help me figure it out!”

**Objectives:**

- Rebuild the program above on your computer.
- Add comments near each of the four variables that describe what they store. You must use at least one of each comment type (// and /* */).
- Find the bug in the text displayed and fix it.
- Answer this question: Aside from comments, what else could you do to make this code more understandable?
