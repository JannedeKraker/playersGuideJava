## Day 33 Challenge: Labeling Inventory
You realize that your inventory items are not easy to sort through. If you could make it easy to label all
of your inventory items, it would be easier to know what items you have in your pack.
Modify your inventory program from the previous level as described below.

**Objectives**:

- Override the existing toString method (from the object base class) on all of your inventory item
subclasses to give them a name. For example, new Rope().toString() should return "Rope".
- Override toString on the Pack class to display the contents of the pack. If a pack contains water,
rope, and two arrows, then calling toString on that Pack object could look like "Pack
containing Water Rope Arrow Arrow".
- Before the user chooses the next item to add, display the packâ€™s current contents via its new
toString method.
