- Copy the code above into a new project. done

- Create a RobotCommand class with a public and abstract void run(Robot robot) method. (The
code above should compile after this step.) done

- Make OnCommand and OffCommand classes that inherit from RobotCommand and turn the robot
on or off by overriding the `run` method.  done

- Make a NorthCommand, SouthCommand, WestCommand, and EastCommand that move the robot 1
unit in the +y direction, 1 unit in the -y direction, 1 unit in the -x direction, and 1 unit in the +x
direction, respectively. Also, ensure that these commands only work if the robot’s isPowered is true.

I have to start with this:
- Make your main method able to collect three commands from the console window. Generate new
RobotCommand objects based on the text entered. After filling the robot’s command set with these
new RobotCommand objects, use the robot’s `run` method to execute them. For example:
```
on
north
west

[0 0 True]
[0 1 True]
[-1 1 True]
