- Change your abstract RobotCommand class into an RobotCommand interface. done

- Remove the unnecessary public and abstract keywords from the run method. done

- Change the Robot class to use the interface. // How can I do that? He already does it without changing anything.

- Make all of your commands implement this new interface instead of extending the RobotCommand
class that no longer exists. You will also want to remove the @Override keywords in these classes. done

- Ensure your program still compiles and runs. done

- Answer this question: Do you feel this is an improvement over using an abstract base class? Why
or why not? in this case not, but if you have to use more different interfaces, then it is more convenient.
