## Narrative 1: The Fountain of Objects

As you eat soup with Simula, she explains that she is the Caretaker of the Heart of Object-Oriented
Programming—the glowing green gem in the box. For thousands of clock cycles, she has held onto it,
hoping that someday, a Programmer who understood object-oriented programming would appear to
restore the Fountain of Objects, destroyed by The Uncoded One, back to what it once was: the lifeblood
of the entire island.
She tells you that to do this, you must gather the five keys of Object-Oriented Programming and make
your way to the Fountain of Objects, whose location is secret. She tells you you can discover its location
if you visit the Catacombs of the Class and marks that location on your map.
You leave Simula’s hovel behind and begin the quest to restore the Fountain of Objects to what it once
was. Your next destination: the Catacombs of the Class!

## Day 21 Challenge 1/2: Vin Fletcher’s Arrows
Vin Fletcher is a skilled arrow maker. He asks for your help building a new class to represent arrows and
determine how much he should sell them for.“A tiny fragment of my soul goes into each arrow; I care
not for the money; I just need to be able to recoup my costs and get food on the table,” he says.
Each arrow has three parts: the arrowhead (steel, wood, or obsidian),the shaft (a length between 60 and
100 cm long), and the fletching (plastic, turkey feathers, or goose feathers).
His costs are as follows: For arrowheads, steel costs 10 gold, wood costs 3 gold, and obsidian costs 5 gold.
For fletching, plastic costs 10 gold, turkey feathers cost 5 gold, and goose feathers cost 3 gold. For the
shaft, the price depends on the length: 0.05 gold per centimeter.

**Objectives**:

- Define a new Arrow class with fields for arrowhead type, fletching type, and length. (Hint: arrowhead types and fletching types might be good enumerations.)
- Allow a user to pick the arrowhead, fletching type, and length and then create a new Arrow instance.
- Add a getCost method that returns its cost as a float based on the numbers above, and use this to display the arrow’s cost.

## Day 21 Challenge 2/2: Vin’s Trouble
“Master Programmer!” Vin Fletcher shouts at you as he races to catch up to you. “I have a problem. I
created an arrow for a young man who took it and changed its length to be half as long as I had designed.
It no longer fit in his bow correctly and misfired. It sliced his hand pretty bad. He’ll survive, but is there
any way we can make sure somebody doesn’t change an arrow’s length when they walk away from my
shop? I don’t want to be the cause of such self-inflicted pain.”With your knowledge of information hiding,
you know you can help.

**Objectives**:

- Modify your Arrow class to have private instead of public fields.
- Add in getter methods for each of the fields that you have.

## Day 22 Challenge: Arrow Factories
Vin Fletcher sometimes makes custom-ordered arrows, but these are rare. Most of the time, he sells one
of the following standard arrows:
- The Elite Arrow, made from a steel arrowhead, plastic fletching, and a 95 cm shaft.
- The Beginner Arrow, made from a wood arrowhead, goose feathers, and a 75 cm shaft.
- The Marksman Arrow, made from a steel arrowhead, goose feathers, and a 65 cm shaft.
You can make static methods to make these specific variations of arrows easy.

**Objectives**:

- Modify your Arrow class one final time to include static methods of the form public static
Arrow createEliteArrow() { ... } for each of the three above arrow types.
- Modify the program to allow users to choose one of these pre-defined types or a custom arrow. If
they select one of the predefined styles, produce an Arrow instance using one of the new static
methods. If
they select one of the predefined styles, produce an Arrow instance using one of the new static
methods. If they choose to make a custom arrow, use your earlier code to get their custom data
about the desired arrow.
