- Put the three class definitions above into a new package.
- Define a generic class to represent a colored item. It must have properties for the item itself (generic
in type) and a ConsoleColor associated with it.
- Add a void display() method to your colored item type that changes the console’s foreground
color to the item’s color and displays the item in that color.
- In your main method, create a new colored item containing a blue sword, a red bow, and a green axe.
Display all three items to see each item displayed in its color.
