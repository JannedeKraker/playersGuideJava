## Day 10: Challenge: Watchtower
There are watchtowers in the region around Consolas that can alert
you when an enemy is spotted. With some help from you, they can tell
you which direction the enemy is from the watchtower.

**Objectives:**

- Ask the user for an x value and a y value. These are coordinates of
the enemy relative to the watchtower’s location. Positive x-values are east, positive y-values are north (as they would be on a normal graph)
- Using if statements and relational operators, display a message about what direction the enemy is coming from. For example, “The enemy is to the northwest!” or “The enemy is here!
