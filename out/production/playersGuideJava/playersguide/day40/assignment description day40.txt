## Day 40 Challenge 1/2: Small, Medium, or Large
The larger the Cavern of Objects is, the more difficult the game becomes. The basic game only requires
a small 4×4 world, but we will add a medium 6×6 world and a large 8×8 world for this challenge.

**Objectives**:

- Before the game begins, ask the player whether they want to play a small, medium, or large game.
Create a 4×4 world if they choose a small world, a 6×6 world if they choose a medium world, and an
8×8 world if they choose a large world.
- Pick an appropriate location for both the Fountain Room and the Entrance room.
- Note: When combined with the Amaroks, Maelstroms, or Pits challenges, you will need to adapt the
game by adding amaroks, maelstroms, and pits to all three sizes.


## Day 40 Challenge 2/2: Pits
The Cavern of Objects is a dangerous place. Some rooms open up to bottomless pits. Entering a pit
means death. The player can sense a pit is in an adjacent room because a draft of air pushes through the
pits into adjacent rooms. Add pit rooms to the game. End the game if the player stumbles into one.

**Objectives**:

- Add a pit room to your 4×4 cavern anywhere that isn’t the fountain or entrance room.
- Players can sense the draft blowing out of pits in adjacent rooms (all eight directions): “You feel a
draft. There is a pit in a nearby room.”
- If a player ends their turn in a room with a pit, they lose the game.
- Note: When combined with the Small, Medium, or Large challenge, add one pit to the 4×4 world,two
pits to the 6×6 world, and four pits to the 8×8 world, in locations of your choice.
