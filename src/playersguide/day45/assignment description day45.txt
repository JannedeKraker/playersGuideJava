## Day 45 Challenge 1/2: Lists of Commands
In Level 27, we encountered a robot with an array to hold commands to run. But we could make the robot
have as many commands as we want by turning the array into a list. Revisit that challenge to make the
robot use a list instead of an array, and add commands to run until the user says to stop.

**Objectives**:

• Change the Robot class to use a `List<RobotCommand>` instead of an array for its Commands (you can use an `ArrayList` as the concrete class to base the List on).
• Instead of looping three times, go until the user types stop.Then run all of the commands created.
