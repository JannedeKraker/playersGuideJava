## Narrative 3: The Chamber of Design
As you finish the final class and place its complete definition back on its pedestal, the writing on each
pedestal begins to glow a reddish-orange. A beam forms from each pedestal, extending upward towards
the high cavernous ceiling. Additional runes on the wall begin to shine as well, and the far walls slide
apart, revealing an opening further into the Catacombs.
You pass through to the next chamber and find three more pedestals with etched text. On the floor, in
a ring running around the three pedestals, lie the words, “Only a True Programmer can design a system
of objects for the ancient games of the people.”
You must make an object-oriented design (not a complete program) for each game described on the
three pedestals in the room’s center to continue further.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
For the next three assignments, do _not_ write a program, only make a design on paper about the objects you need. You can use [CRC cards](http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/crcModel.htm) or [UML class diagrams](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/uml-class-diagram-tutorial/) or any other method to express the global design and functionality of a class on paper -_without writing any code!!!_.

## Day 28 Design Challenge: Rock-Paper-Scissors
The first design pedestal requires you to provide an object-oriented design—a set of objects, classes,
and how they interact—for the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, described below:
- Two human players compete against each other.
- Each player picks Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- Depending on the players’ choices, a winner is determined: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper,
Paper beats Rock. If both players pick the same option, it is a draw.
- The game must display who won the round.
- The game will keep running rounds until the window is closed but must remember the historical
record of how many times each player won and how many draws there were.

**Objectives**:

- Use CRC cards (or a suitable alternative) to outline the objects and classes that may be needed to
make the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. You do not need to create this full game; just come up
with a potential design as a starting point.
