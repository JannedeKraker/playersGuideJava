//Simula is impressed with how you reconstructed the box with an enumeration.
//        When the box opened, you saw a glowing emerald gem inside. You don’t know
//        what it is, but it seems important. Also in the box were three vials of powder
//        labeled HOT, SALTY, and SWEET. “Finally! I can make soup again!” Simula
//        says. She casually tosses the small glowing gem to you but is wholly focused on
//        the powders. “You stick around and help me make soup with your programming
//        skills, and I’ll tell you what that gem does.” She pulls out a cookpot, knocks the
//        clutter off the table with a quick sweep of her arm, and begins cooking. She says,
//        “I’m the best soup maker in town, and you’re in for a treat. I’ve got recipes
//        for soup, stew, and gumbo. I’ve got mushrooms, chicken, carrots, and potatoes
//        for ingredients. And thanks to you getting that box open, I’ve got seasonings
//        again! Spicy, salty, and sweet seasoning. Pick a recipe, an ingredient, and a
//        seasoning, and I’ll make it. Use your programming skills to help us track what
//        we make.”
//        Objectives:
//        • Define enumerations for the three variations on food: type (soup, stew,
//        gumbo), main ingredient (mushrooms, chicken, carrots, potatoes), and
//        seasoning (spicy, salty, sweet).
//        • Make a class to represent a soup composed of the three above enumeration
//        types.
//        • Let the user pick a type, main ingredient, and seasoning from the allowed
//        choices and fill the “soup object” with the results. Hint: You could give
//        the user a menu to pick from or simply compare the user’s text input
//        against specific strings to determine which enumeration value represents
//        their choice.
//        • When done, display the contents of the soup object in a format like
//        “Sweet Chicken Gumbo.” Hint: You don’t need to convert the enumer-
//        ation value back to a string. Simply displaying an enumeration value
//        with System.out.print or System.out.printlin will display the name of the
//        enumeration value.)

//Narrative 1: The Fountain of Objects
//        As you eat soup with Simula, she explains that she is the Caretaker of the Heart
//        of Object-Oriented Programming—the glowing green gem in the box. For thou-
//        sands of clock cycles, she has held onto it, hoping that someday, a Programmer
//        who understood object-oriented programming would appear to restore the Foun-
//        tain of Objects, destroyed by The Uncoded One, back to what it once was: the
//        lifeblood of the entire island. She tells you that to do this, you must gather the
//        five keys of Object-Oriented Programming and make your way to the Fountain
//        of Objects, whose location is secret. She tells you you can discover its location
//        if you visit the Catacombs of the Class and marks that location on your map.
//        You leave Simula’s hovel behind and begin the quest to restore the Fountain
//        of Objects to what it once was. Your next destination: the Catacombs of the
//        Class!
