## Day 2: 1/3 - Challenge What Comes Next

The man seems surprised that you’ve produced a working “Hello, World!” program. “Been a while since I
saw somebody program like that around here. Do you know what you’re doing with that? Can you make
it do something besides just say ‘hello’?”

Build on your original Hello World program with the following:

**Objectives:**
-  Change your program to say something besides “Hello,World!”


## Day 2: 2/3 - Challenge The Makings of a Programmer
The man, who tells you his name is Ritlin, asks you to follow him over to a few of his friends, fishing on
the dock. “This one here has the makings of a Programmer!” Ritlin says. The group looks at you with eyes
widening and mouths agape. Ritlin turns back to you and continues, “I haven’t seen nor heard tell of
anybody who can wield that power in a million clock cycles of the CPU. Nobody has been able to do that
since the Uncoded One showed up in these lands.” He describes the shadowy and mysterious Uncoded
One, an evil power that rots programs and perhaps even the world itself. The Uncoded One’s presence
has prevented anybody from wielding the power of programming, the only thing that might be able to
stop it. Yet somehow, you have been able to grab hold of this power anyway. Ritlin’s companions suddenly
seem doubtful. “Can you show them what you showed me? Use some of that Programming of yours to
make a program? Maybe something with more than one statement in it?”

**Objectives:**

- Make a program with 5 `System.out.println` statements in it.
- Answer this question: How many statements do you think a program can contain?

## Day 2: 3/3 - Challenge Consolas and Telim
These lands have not seen Programming in a long time due to the blight of the Uncoded One. Even old
programs are now crumbling to bits. Your skills with Programming are only fledgling now, but you can
still make a difference in these people’s lives. Maybe someday soon, your skills will have grown strong
enough to take on the Uncoded One directly. But for now, you decide to do what you can to help.
In the nearby city of Consolas, food is running short.Telim has a magic oven that can produce bread from
thin air. He is willing to share, but Telim is an Excelian, and Excelians love paperwork; they demand it for
all transactions—no exceptions. Telim will share his bread with the city if you can build a program that
lets him enter the names of those receiving it.

A sample run of this program looks like this:

```
Bread is ready.
Who is the bread for?
RB
Noted: RB got bread.
```

**Objectives:**

- Make a program that runs as shown above, including taking a name from the user
