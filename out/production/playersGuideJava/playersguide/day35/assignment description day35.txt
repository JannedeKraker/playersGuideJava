## Day 35 Challenge: Robotic Interface
With your knowledge of interfaces, you realize you can refine the old robot you found in the mud to use
interfaces instead of the original design. Instead of an abstract RobotCommand base class, it could
become an RobotCommand interface!
Building on your solution to the Old Robot challenge, perform the changes below:

**Objectives**:

- Change your abstract RobotCommand class into an RobotCommand interface.
- Remove the unnecessary public and abstract keywords from the run method.
- Change the Robot class to use the interface
- Make all of your commands implement this new interface instead of extending the RobotCommand
class that no longer exists. You will also want to remove the @Override keywords in these classes.
- Ensure your program still compiles and runs.
- Answer this question: Do you feel this is an improvement over using an abstract base class? Why
or why not?
